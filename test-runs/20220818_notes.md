# 20220818 Notes

## Method

I wrote a some bash functions today to spin up virtual clusters and import them into rancher. see [test.sh](../bin/test.sh) The method is fairly trivial and straightforward however I was not able to successfully import more than about 25 clusters - I do wonder if the network from a single machine is the bottleneck. I didn’t have a chance to test that theory quite yet. The methodology is this:

1. create cluster in rancher
1. create vcluster on arm HPC with rancher import as init configuration - auto import essentially
1. wait until rancher returns cluster condition `Ready=True`
1. repeat

### To run the sample tests:
```
# Set ACCESS_TOKEN and RANCHER_HOST accordingly
make install_scripts
source test.sh
create-n <max_cluster_id> <start_id>
```

### To clean up the sample clusters
`delete-n <max_cluster_id> <start_id>`


Clusters generally are ready within 2 minutes of creation. If you look at the [20220818_timings.txt](../test-runs/20220818_timings.txt) file you can see the failures are all just over 5 minutes - the time limit I chose to conclude a cluster is not ready and we should move on. Once, in the current output, we see a cluster come Ready after a failure but then it’s all downhill from there. I ran the test several times today with nearly identical results - failure at cluster 25.
